This is a simple project to study and play with Android components, architecture and tools for Android development. This application is used to present daily and future weather information.

### Tech Stack
This project uses MVVM as software design pattern for presentation layer, android embedded jetback component library for app navigation and shared preferences to store local user preference.

## Development setup

You require Android Studio 4.2 or higher with the Android 11 SDK to be able to build the application. 

### Libraries
- Application entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)
- Asynchronous work processing using [Coroutines](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/)
- Uses [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to manage network calls 
- Uses [Material UI](https://m2.material.io/develop/android) for adapitive UI design 

### API keys
You need to create your own API / client keys for the service the app uses.
- [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/current#zip)

Once you obtain the key, you can set them in your `~/local.properties`:
```
# Get this from open weather map website
OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY=<insert>
```
